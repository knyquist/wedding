        We're excited to bring our friends and family together
        to celebrate our love and committment in marriage. The
        wedding will happen on Saturday, September 22, 2018
        at a venue right in heart of Santa Cruz.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ceremony will start at 5 PM and be followed by a 
        reception where we'll celebrate with food, dancing, and 
        drinks. Cocktails and dinner will immediately follow the
        ceremony outdoors.

        Santa Cruz is usually warm during this time of year, but 
        the weather certainly can dip down to the high 50s/ low 60s
        as night approaches. Don't forget to bring something warm if
        you might get chilly.
