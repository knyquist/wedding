      	  <p><em><b>Getting to the venue</b></em> 
      	  <br>
      	  We suggest walking or getting a ride to the museum so you donâ€™t have to worry about your car at the end of the evening. Most accomodations are within a mile or two of the venue and a Lyft/Uber/taxi will be very affordable. If you would like to drive there is a parking garage next door to the venue (Soquel/Front Street Parking Garage), which has very reasonable rates. Street parking is also available but can be unpredictable.</p>

          <p><em><b>Accomodations</b></em>
          <br>
          Motels and Airbnbs abound in Santa Cruz. Most of the motels have a beachy, roadtrip vibe. We recommend grouping together with friends or family and going in on an Airbnb together. As far as motels go, there are many within walking distance. We've never stayed at any motels in Santa Cruz, so we don't have any strong recommendations. Below are some close-by accomodations that are reasonably priced and have relatively good internet reviews. The name, distance to venue, phone number, and address are listed. There are many other options, however! Feel free to explore! You may want to stay closer to the beaches!
